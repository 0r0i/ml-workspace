The ML workspace is an all-in-one web-based IDE specialized for machine learning and data science. It is simple to deploy and gets you started within minutes to productively built and train ML solutions on your own machines. This workspace is the ultimate tool for developers preloaded with a variety of popular data science libraries (e.g., Tensorflow, PyTorch, Keras, Sklearn) and dev tools (e.g., Jupyter, VS Code, Tensorboard) perfectly configured, optimized, and integrated.

## Highlights

- üí´ Jupyter, JupyterLab, and Visual Studio Code web-based IDEs.
- üóÉ Pre-installed with many popular data science libraries & tools.
- üñ• Full Linux desktop GUI accesible via web browser.
- üîÄ Seamless Git integration optimized for notebooks.
- üö™ Access from anywhere via Web, SSH, or VNC under a single port.
- üê≥ Easy to deploy on Mac, Linux, and Windows via Docker.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

The Workspace requires **Docker** üê≥ to be installed on your machine ([Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/install/#supported-platforms)).

> üìñ _If you are new to Docker, we recommend to take a look at [this wonderful beginner guide](https://docker-curriculum.com/)._

### Start single instance

Deploying a single Workspace instance is as simple as:

```bash
docker run -d --name ml-workspace -p 8091:8091 --restart always mltooling/ml-workspace:latest
```

Voil√†, that was easy üòå Now, Docker will pull the latest workspace image to your machine. This may take a few minutes depending on your internet speed. Grab a coffee ‚òï and dream about all the exciting things you can built with Machine Learning ü¶Ñ. Once the workspace is started, you can access it via: http://localhost:8091. 

> ‚òùÔ∏è _If started on a remote machine or with a different port, make sure to use the machines IP/DNS and/or the exposed port._

### Persist Data

To persist the data, you need to mount a volume into `/workspace`.

### Configuration

The container can be configured with following environment variables (`--env`):

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Variable</th>
        <th>Description</th>
        <th>Default</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>WORKSPACE_BASE_URL</td>
        <td>The base URL under which the notebook server is reachable. E.g. setting it to /workspace, the workspace would be reachable under /workspace/tree</td>
        <td>/</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td colspan="3">Jupyter Configuration:</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td colspan="3">VNC Configuration:</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>VNC_PW</td>
        <td>Password of VNC Connection</td>
        <td>vncpassword</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>VNC_RESOLUTION</td>
        <td>Desktop Resolution of VNC Connection</td>
        <td>1600x900</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>VNC_COL_DEPTH</td>
        <td>Color Depth of VNC Connection</td>
        <td>24</td>
    </tr>
</table>
